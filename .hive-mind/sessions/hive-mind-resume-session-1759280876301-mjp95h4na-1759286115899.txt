You are resuming a Hive Mind session with comprehensive context:

📋 SESSION DETAILS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 Session ID: session-1759280876301-mjp95h4na
📌 Swarm ID: swarm-1759280876300-8w8vhk75y
📌 Swarm Name: hive-1759280876294
🎯 Objective: create a personal 'dotfiles' repo using ansible that uses zsh, tmux, and neovim as main tools and targets debian, macos, and arch linux for deployment. this dotfiles should support the simplest case where the user clones the dotfiles from github and runs an install script to bootstrap a new machine

🎯 RESUMPTION PROTOCOL:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. **RESTORE CONTEXT**:
   - Review all checkpoint data and activity history above
   - Use mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage to retrieve collective memory
   - Check agent statuses and reassign tasks if needed
   - Verify all in-progress tasks are still valid

2. **CONTINUE EXECUTION**:
   - Resume in-progress tasks with their assigned agents
   - Process pending tasks based on priority (CRITICAL > HIGH > NORMAL > LOW)
   - Maintain agent coordination through memory sharing
   - Update progress tracking after each task completion

3. **COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Use mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage for all cross-agent communication
   - Apply consensus mechanisms for important decisions
   - Maintain swarm topology: hierarchical
   - Keep session checkpoint data updated regularly

4. **MEMORY CONTEXT**:
   - Session memory namespace: session-session-1759280876301-mjp95h4na
   - Swarm memory namespace: swarm-swarm-1759280876300-8w8vhk75y
   - Use these namespaces to access historical decisions and context

Resume the hive mind operation with full context awareness and continue working towards the objective.
