## Requirement Coverage

### Architecture Portability (Phase 5)
- [x] ARCH-01: APT repositories use dynamic architecture detection
- [x] ARCH-02: Go installation detects architecture
- [x] ARCH-03: Playbooks work on ARM64 Debian

### Idempotency (Phase 6)
- [x] IDEM-01: Go install has creates guards
- [x] IDEM-02: Mason install has creates guards
- [x] IDEM-03: npm install -g has creates guards
- [x] IDEM-04: uv tool install has creates guards
- [x] IDEM-05: Re-runs show changed=0

### Bug Fixes (Phase 7)
- [x] BUG-01: SSH known_hosts uses ssh-keygen -F
- [x] BUG-02: Debian non-free repos use deb822_repository

### LTS Version Policy (Phase 8)
- [x] LTS-01: Tools use LTS versions where available

**Total: 11/11 requirements (100%)**
