# Milestone v0.3: Security & Documentation

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-23
**Phases:** 9-10
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

This milestone hardened curl-to-shell script patterns used in bootstrap/tool installation and documented risks and recovery procedures. Phase 9 addressed script security through version pinning, checksum verification, and GPG key documentation. Phase 10 captured operational knowledge in documentation.

## Phases

### Phase 9: Script Security

**Goal**: Curl-to-shell installation scripts are pinned to verifiable versions
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (v0.2 complete)
**Requirements**: SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All curl-piped scripts reference specific commits or version tags, not master/main branches
  2. Scripts with published checksums have verification steps in playbooks
  3. GPG key fingerprints for package repositories are documented in playbook comments
  4. Running `ansible-lint` still passes after changes
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md - Pin curl-to-shell scripts (Homebrew, Pulumi, uv) + security comments for unpinnable scripts
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md - Add checksum verification to sops + GPG fingerprint comments to 9 APT tools

### Phase 10: Documentation

**Goal**: Operational risks and procedures are documented for maintainer reference
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: DOC-01, DOC-02, DOC-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. nvm curl-to-shell risk is documented with mitigation options
  2. Rollback/recovery procedures exist for common failure scenarios
  3. Theme system testing guidance is present in CLAUDE.md
  4. Documentation is findable (in expected locations: README, CLAUDE.md, or .planning/)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md - Add Security Considerations, Troubleshooting, and theme testing documentation

## Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|

| SEC-02 | Phase 9 | Checksums verified for downloaded scripts where available |
| SEC-03 | Phase 9 | GPG key fingerprints documented in playbook comments |
| DOC-01 | Phase 10 | nvm dependency risk documented |
| DOC-02 | Phase 10 | Rollback/recovery procedures documented |
| DOC-03 | Phase 10 | Theme system testing guidance added to CLAUDE.md |

All 6/6 v0.3 requirements shipped.

## Progress

| Phase | Milestone | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 9. Script Security | v0.3 | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-01-23 |
| 10. Documentation | v0.3 | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-01-23 |

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Pin to latest Homebrew commit SHA (90fa3d5) for reproducibility
- Use version flags for Pulumi (3.216.0) and uv (0.9.26)
- Document unpinnable scripts with alternatives rather than removing them
- Use ansible.builtin.get_url with checksum instead of curl for binary downloads
- Document GPG fingerprints as YAML comments with verification URLs
- Combined Security and Troubleshooting sections in README.md for discoverability

**Issues Resolved:**
- Supply chain risk for curl-to-shell scripts
- Missing rollback/recovery documentation
- Theme system testing unclear for maintainers

**Issues Deferred:**
- Minor theme file reference issue in docs (references old file naming)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Pre-existing 22 ansible-lint violations remain (not introduced by v0.3)
