## Problem

Need to confirm GSD (Get Shit Done) is correctly installed at the latest version according to the official GitHub repository. This ensures we have all the latest workflows, templates, and bug fixes before building v1.1 features that integrate with GSD.

## Solution

1. Check official GSD GitHub repo for latest version/release
2. Compare with currently installed version
3. Update if needed via `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest`
4. Verify installation works with `/gsd:help` or similar command
