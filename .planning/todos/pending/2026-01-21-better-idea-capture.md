## Problem

Current idea capture relies on GSD todos in .planning/todos/. This is fine for project-specific tasks but may not be ideal for quick thoughts, random ideas, or cross-project notes.

## Solution

TBD - explore options:
- Obsidian quick capture?
- CLI tool that appends to a central inbox?
- Voice memo transcription?
- Integration with existing note system?
