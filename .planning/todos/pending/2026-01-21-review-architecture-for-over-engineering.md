## Problem

Review the _dotfiles architecture and GSD planning structure for potential over-engineering. The project is a personal dotfiles repo but has accumulated significant planning infrastructure (.planning/, multiple phases, roadmaps, etc.). Evaluate whether the tooling/process complexity is proportionate to the actual task complexity.

Areas to examine:
- Is the three-phase milestone structure necessary for a lint cleanup task?
- Could simpler approaches achieve the same goals?
- What's the maintenance burden of the planning documents?

## Solution

TBD — requires architectural review with fresh perspective
