title: Build ChatGPT desktop app with Tauri

## Problem

Currently using lencx/ChatGPT which is an unofficial Electron wrapper. Electron apps are heavy (memory, disk). Would prefer a lighter native-feeling app.

## Solution

Build own ChatGPT wrapper using Tauri (Rust backend, webview frontend). Lighter than Electron, better system integration.
