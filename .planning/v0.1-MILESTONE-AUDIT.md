**Score:** 10/10 requirements satisfied

## Phase Status

### Phase 1: Lint Cleanup ✓

**Status:** Complete (verified 2026-01-20)
**Score:** 5/5 success criteria met

All targeted violations eliminated:
- fqcn[action-core]: 413 → 0
- fqcn[action]: 64 → 0
- yaml[truthy]: 264 → 0
- name[play]: ~100 → 0
- yaml[line-length]: 12 → 0
- latest[git]: 3 → 0

### Phase 2: Validation ✓

**Status:** Complete (validated 2026-01-21)
**Score:** 3/3 success criteria met

Ran `./setup-all.sh` on all hosts:
- **desktop (local):** 323 tasks OK, 0 failures
- **macmini (remote):** 318 tasks OK, 0 failures
- macbookair: unreachable (machine offline)
- miniserver: unreachable (machine offline)

Unreachable hosts are infrastructure issues (machines powered off), not playbook failures. All reachable hosts passed.

### Phase 3: Tooling ✓

**Status:** Complete (implemented 2026-01-21)
**Score:** 3/3 success criteria met

The ansible-lint hook:
- **Source:** `tools/claude-code/hooks/ansible-lint.sh`
- **Deployed via:** `install_claude-code.yml` (ansible.builtin.copy task)
- **Registered:** `~/.claude/settings.json` (PostToolUse for Edit|Write)
- **Behavior:** Triggers on .yml file edits in _dotfiles, reports lint errors

## Validation Results

### setup-all.sh Execution (2026-01-21)

```
PLAY RECAP (localhost)
desktop: ok=323 changed=14 unreachable=0 failed=0

PLAY RECAP (remote hosts)
macmini:    ok=318 changed=24 unreachable=0 failed=0
macbookair: ok=0   changed=0  unreachable=1 failed=0
miniserver: ok=0   changed=0  unreachable=1 failed=0
```

**Result:** PASS — All reachable hosts succeeded with zero failures.

## Tech Debt

### Non-targeted Lint Violations (270 remaining)

These were explicitly out of scope for v0.1:

| Violation Type | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| command-instead-of-shell | 110 |
| risky-file-permissions | 72 |
| no-changed-when | 36 |
| command-instead-of-module | 29 |
| risky-shell-pipe | 19 |
| deprecated-local-action | 1 |
| Other | 3 |

**Recommendation:** Track in v0.2+ backlog

### Planning Documentation

Phase 3 was implemented during gap closure without formal planning artifacts (CONTEXT.md, PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md). The hook works correctly; documentation was skipped for efficiency.
